An Afrikaans online shop, where Vendors register and sell items to registered Clients. 

The webpage is developed using HTML/CSS and Bootstrap for the webpage layouts, an MySQL database together with PHP and Javascript to handle the Client and Server side communications. 

The website was developed in my 4th year as part of a project to show database knowledge.
